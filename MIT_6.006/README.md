# 6.006: Introductions To Algorithms

[6.006 Introduction To Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020)
from the MIT OpenCourseWare.

I opened this repo to give me the social pressure to finish the course.

## Course Description

> This course is an introduction to mathematical modeling of computational
> problems, as well as common algorithms, algorithmic paradigms, and data
> structures used to solve these problems. It emphasizes the relationship
> between algorithms and programming and introduces basic performance measures
> and analysis techniques for these problems.
